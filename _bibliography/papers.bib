  abstract={The influence of haptic interaction in human-human, human-robot, and human-robot-human teams is a growing field of research. Prior investigations of robot-based haptic dyads have shown that a haptic connection to a partner during motor training may improve motor learning. These studies, however, primarily investigate healthy young adults. Stroke patients may benefit from learning with a haptic connection to a partner, but it is unclear if this connection will cause the patient to slack-reducing their effort or attention during training. We present our design for the TheraDyad, a low-cost robotic rehabilitation system to haptically connect dyads with and without impairments. We also present preliminary motor learning and user experience results for nine participants (61.7 Â± 4.9 years), of whom three are post-stroke and six are healthy, learning a 1-DOF target tracking task with the TheraDyad. Our findings support the usability of TheraDyad and suggest that stroke survivors do not reduce effort when paired with a healthy partner. Furthermore, we provide preliminary evidence that interacting with a healthy partner improves motor learning for the post-stroke partner. More work is needed to generalize these results and draw clear conclusions about the use of haptic dyads for multi-user robot-based post-stroke rehabilitation.}

  abstract={Rehabilitation robots have the potential to alleviate the global burden of neurorehabilitation. Robot-based multiplayer gaming with virtual and haptic interaction may improve motivation, engagement, and implicit learning in robotic therapy. Over the past few years, there has been growing interest in robot mediated haptic dyads, or human-robot-robot-human interaction. The effect of such a paradigm on motor learning in general and specifically for individuals with motor and/or cognitive impairments is an open area of research. We reviewed the literature to investigate the effect of a robot-based haptic dyad on motor learning. Thirty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria for this review. We summarize study characteristics including device, haptic rendering, and experimental task. Our main findings indicate that dyadic training's impact on motor learning is inconsistent in that some studies show significant improvement of motor training while others show no influence. We also find that the relative skill level of the partner and interaction characteristics such as stiffness of connection and availability of visual information influence motor learning outcomes. We discuss implications for neurorehabilitation and conclude that additional research is needed to determine optimal interaction characteristics for motor learning and to extend this research to individuals with cognitive and motor impairments.}

  abstract={The ability to detect an individual's confidence in motor performance may be useful in physical rehabilitation paradigms. This is particularly relevant in ambient settings where kinematic features can be easily obtained from wearable sensors. The purpose of the current approach is to determine the extent to which kinematic features can be used to classify task-specific confidence. Ten unimpaired adults performed a goal-directed target reaching task. Kinematic features and instruments sensitive to multiple constructs of confidence were obtained for all participants. We found a subset of kinematic parameters (percent time to peak velocity, peak velocity) were sensitive to task difficulty as measured by reaching self-efficacy (RSE, p<0.001, p=0.009). Additionally, our results indicate that a k-nearest neighbors classifier with k=8 was capable of distinguishing task difficulty (i.e., target distance) based on kinematic features. Future work will focus on further investigation of this paradigm in a larger variety of more challenging tasks.}

  abstract={The recovery of Upper Extremity (UE) motor function is essential for activity of daily living (ADL) performance in individuals with impairment post-stroke. During this recovery process, task difficulty may cause individuals to avoid certain behaviors beneficial to their rehabilitation. Because most ADL performance occurs in the home, monitoring task performance and task difficulty in the ambient setting is a necessary aspect of identifying and correcting UE motor deficits. In this study, we focus on determining relationships between a kinematic measure of performance and task challenge. Ten non-disabled participants completed a reaching task and target dependent self-efficacy assessments based on a validated goal directed paradigm. The participants also completed assessments of UE motor function, which were used to establish initial, task specific self-efficacy. The results of this study suggest that position pulse width is a kinematic indicator of relative task challenge in our goal directed reaching task. The results do not support a relationship between average pulse width and initial performer confidence level. These results may have implications for the eventual monitoring of participant confidence in ambient settings.}
