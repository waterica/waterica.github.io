<!-- I am a PhD candidate in mechanical engineering and applied mechanics at the University of Pennsylvania. I received my B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Tennessee and my M.S.E in robotics from the University of Pennsylvania. I have been awarded a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein Predoctoral Individual National Research Service Award. I am passionate about developing affordable rehabilitation robotic systems that improve quality of life for individuals with disabilities. My undergraduate research focused on relating kinematic data of upper-extremity reaching to task-specific confidence with implications on post-stroke patient monitoring through wearable sensors. My PhD work is focused on creating meaningful haptic interactions for post-stroke individuals using rehabilitation robots. To achieve this goal, I am studying how humans in a robot-based haptic dyad jointly learn motor tasks and leveraging novel control techniques to improve human-robot-human and human-robot interaction in the rehabilitation setting. My research interests include haptics, controls, human-robot interaction, and rehabilitation robotics. -->

I am a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics at the University of Pennsylvania, where I design rehabilitation robotic systems to make recovery more accessible, affordable, and human-centered for people with disabilities. My work focuses on creating meaningful haptic interactions that support motor learning and foster collaboration between people and robots.

As an undergraduate at the University of Tennessee, I volunteered with students with disabilities and designed assistive devices through student organizations. I also conducted research on how upper-limb movement kinematics relate to confidence in task performance, with implications for post-stroke monitoring. I went on to pursue my PhD at Penn, picking up an M.S.E. in Robotics along the way. My graduate research explores how people learn motor skills together in haptic dyads and how control strategies can be designed to enhance both individual recovery and social interaction in rehabilitation.

I have received support from the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein Predoctoral NRSA (F31). My long-term goal is to bring empathetic, intelligent rehabilitation technology out of the lab and into real-world use, particularly in underserved clinical settings. I am also passionate about research mentorship and STEM outreach, especially at the Kâ€“12 level.
