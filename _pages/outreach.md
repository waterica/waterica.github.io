**K-12 STEM Outreach**
As an undergraduate student, I volunteered at STEM outreach activities with the <a href="https://utk.swe.org/outreach-volunteering/">Society of Women Engineers</a> and <a href="https://tnscioly.utk.edu/">Tennessee Science Olympiad</a>. As part of the EF 327 class, Honors: Engineering Design in K-12 Education, I developed engineering curriculum materials for high school students in the Knox County School district and created a <a href="https://sites.google.com/vols.utk.edu/easttnstemhub/resources-for-families-and-teachers/stem-sparks#h.qhoy47bivb6y">Hover Craft STEMspark</a> activity video for elementary aged students. As a graduate student, I have taught STEM lessons to middle school aged students in the <a href="https://gems.seas.upenn.edu/">Penn GEMS Engineering, Science, and Math Camp</a>, led a robotics workshop for high school sophomores in the <a href="https://fi.edu/en/science-and-education/stem-scholars">Franklin Institute STEM Scholars Program</a>, and presented on behalf of the Rehabilitation Robotics Lab at outreach events for high school students. 

**Engineering and Research Mentorship**
In the past, I have mentored undergraduate engineering students as part of the <a href="https://utk.swe.org/sweeties-mentorship-program/">SWEeties Mentorship Program</a> through the University of Tennessee Society of Women Engineers. As a PhD student I have mentored students through programs like <a href="https://fi.edu/en/science-and-education/stem-scholars">Franklin Institute STEM Scholars Program</a>, <a href="https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/news/grasp-lab-welcomes-summer22-aeop-apprenticeship-students/">Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP)</a>, and <a href="https://diversity.seas.upenn.edu/summer-research-program/">National Science Foundation and Philadelphia Region Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (NSF/LSAMP) Undergraduate Research Program</a>.

**Volunteer Work with Individuals with Disabilities**
As an undergraduate student, I helped found <a href="https://mabe.utk.edu/at-crossroads-of-engineering-and-disability-student-innovation-thrives/">Life Without Limits</a>, a student organization focused on designing 3D printed assistive devices for individuals with disabilities. I also volunteered as a peer mentor for students with developmental and intellectual disabilities through the <a href="https://futureut.utk.edu/">FUTURE Postsecondary Education Program</a>.
