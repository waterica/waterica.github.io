**Graduate Teaching Assistant \| University of Pennsylvania**

*MEAM 5200 \| Introduction to Robotics \| 08.2022 - 05.2023*

I was a TA for the Fall 2023 semester and the head TA in the Spring 2023 semester in the Introduction to Robotics course. This course covers the fundamental dynamic, kinematic, and computational principles relevant to modern robotic systems. Topics include: rotation matrices, forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, Jacobians, and trajectory planning. Lecture material is reinforced with hands-on lab time with 7-DOF Franka Emika Panda Arms. In my role as a TA, I led robot lab sessions for small groups, held office hours, updated lab assignments, led weekly TA meetings, directed course logistics, graded assignments, facilitated the final competition, and managed the class discussion board.


**Tutor \| OpenLiteracy**

*9th Grade Geometry \| 01.2021 - 06.2021*

I tutored ninth grade geometry over Zoom. I worked one-on-one with four students and developed individualized digital study materials such as Quizlets and Jamboard. I also held virtual office hours to provide homework help.


**Instructor \| Kids 4 Coding**
