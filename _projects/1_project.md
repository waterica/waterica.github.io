**Description:** For this project, I worked with a team of 3 other students to program the Franka Emika Panda Arm (“Panda”) to pick up both dynamic and static objects, orient them with the z-axis facing up, and stack them. Our entire code had to run autonomously using only the initial poses of the blocks with no updated position information.

**Language:** Python (NumPy, SciPy)

**Key Competencies:** homogeneous transformation matrices, forward kinematics, gradient descent for optimization-based inverse kinematics

**Project Videos:**
