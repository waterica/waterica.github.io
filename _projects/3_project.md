**Description:** I worked with a partner to design and evaluate a model predictive controller (MPC) to assist in trajectory tracking with a simulated 1‑DOF rehabilitation robot. I tested the controller by simulating healthy and post-stroke humans as feedback controllers with using least‑squares method to fit the feedback controller to real human trajectory tracking data collected with the TheraDrive robot. I wrote a report and presented a poster comparing the MPC performance with the simulated humans to a traditional assistive PD controller.

**Language:** Python (PyDrake, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy)

**Key Competencies:** model predictive control, PD control, least-squares method
