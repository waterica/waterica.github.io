**Description:** Beginning my freshman year of college, I worked under Dr. Eric Espinoza-Wade in the Behavior, Robotics, and Sensing Group. My undergraduate research experience was somewhat unique in that I was assigned my own independent project from the start. Specifically, I studied the relationship between kinematic data of upper extremity reaching and task-specific confidence, which has applications for post-stroke patient monitoring through wearable sensors. Over the subsequent two and a half years, I designed and conducted a study and first-authored two conference publications. My first tasks were reading background literature, familiarizing myself with the 3D-motion capture system, and creating a program in MATLAB to process kinematic data. I then designed a study based on an existing goal-directed reaching task paradigm and wrote the test protocol. Over the summer, I recruited participants and collected confidence and kinematic reaching data from each. During my sophomore year, I analyzed the data in MATLAB, performed statistical analyses in SPSS, and first-authored my first conference paper. The next year, I used the same data set to calculate additional kinematic features. I then employed a supervised machine learning algorithm to build a model classifying the task-specific confidence of a reach based on its kinematic features.

**Key Findings:** One key result is that position pulse width is a kinematic indicator of relative task challenge in a goal directed reaching task. Likewise, a subset of kinematic parameters (percent time to peak velocity, peak velocity) are sensitive to task difficulty as measured by reaching self-efficacy (RSE, p <; 0.001, p = 0.009). Furthermore, a k-nearest neighbors classifier with k = 8 was capable of distinguishing task difficulty (i.e., target distance) based on kinematic features. Together, these results may have implications for the eventual monitoring of participant confidence in ambient settings.
