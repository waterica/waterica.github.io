**Description:** Under the direction of Dr. Michelle Johnson, I am investigating how haptic connection to a partner influences learning and retention of a robot-based motor task for individuals with different motor and cognitive abilities. This project is motivated by the idea that haptically connecting post-stroke individuals in a multiplayer game could allow them to take advantage of the social and motivational benefits of multiplayer games as well as the implicit communication channels and increased motor variability afforded by a haptic connection. Our objectives are (1) to study the influence of motor and cognitive impairments on learning and retention of a robot-based motor task while haptically linked to a partner compared to learning a robot-based motor task independently without a haptic connection, (2) to study the influence of varying relative partner motor and cognitive ability levels in a dyad on learning and retention of a robot-based motor task, (3) to study how the exchange of haptic information between human partners can be optimized to improve motor and cognitive learning of a robot-based motor task, and (4) to use our findings from human-robot-robot-human interactions to inform the design of an assistive, human-like robotic controller. So far, I have performed a systematic literature review to investigate the effect of a robot-based haptic dyad on motor learning. The findings of this literature review helped to guide the design of the TheraDyad, a low-cost robotic rehabilitation system to haptically connect dyads. Finally, I have conducted a case study with older adults with and without motor and cognitive impairments to investigate their motor performance, motor learning, and user experience results while using the system.
