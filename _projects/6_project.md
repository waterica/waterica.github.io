**Description:** This project represents a spin-off of my dissertation work. The project involves developing an optimal control model of post-stroke interactions with a rehabilitation robot. The overall goal of the project is to better understanding post-stroke motor control in order to improve assessment.

**Role:** Primary Investigator

**Language:** Python

**Key Competencies:** Optimal control, linear quadratic regulator, human modeling, human kinematics, human-robot interaction, statistical analysis

**Funding:** This project is supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program under Grant No. DGE-1845298, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute Of Child Health & Human Development of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number F31HD116597, and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute Of Child Health & Human Development of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R42HD104325.
